## Scanning in VSCode

:::note[Useful Links]

Initiating scans as described [here](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/quantum-safe/quantum-safe-explorer/1.0.x?topic=extension-initiating-scan)

:::

### Kicking off the scan and seeing results

Let's scan the code base for the `cli` for QSE

In our example, we've created a directory called `QSE` and extracted all the installation elements of QSE.

![Scanning1](../../../assets/images/scanning1.png)

Open that directory in VSCode.

```zsh
cd QSE

code .
```
![Scanning2](../../../assets/images/scanning2.png)

On VSCode, open a new terminal in the code window. This can be done with the following key combo: Ctrl-Shift-Backtick(`)

![Scanning3](../../../assets/images/scanning3.png)

In windows this will open a powershell terminal

Press Ctlr-Shift-P to open the Command Palette and search for `Quantum Safe Explorer`. Select Quantum Safe Explorer Scan.

![Scanning4](../../../assets/images/scanning4.png)

The following notification should pop up

![Scanning5](../../../assets/images/scanning5.png)

Let it scan until it completes.

When the scan completes, you should see the following directories show up in the Explorer window of VSCode

![Scanning6](../../../assets/images/scanning6.png)

We should now see the QUANTUM SAFE EXPLORER DASHBOARD populated with some graphs and charts.
