## Installing required cli tools

### AWS CLI

<Tabs syncKey="OS">
  <TabItem label="MacOS">
Download the client

```zsh
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.pkg" -o "AWSCLIV2.pkg"
```

Install it with sudo (to use for all users)

```zsh
sudo installer -pkg ./AWSCLIV2.pkg -target /
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Windows">
```powershell
msiexec.exe /i https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.msi
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Now let's configure our client env

```zsh
aws configure
```

Answer all the questions with the info you got for your account.

### helm install

<Tabs syncKey="OS">
  <TabItem label="MacOS">

```zsh
curl -fsSL -o get_helm.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3 | bash
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Windows">
To install `helm` to windows, we're going to use a opensource package manager called [scoop](https://scoop.sh/)

Run the following command in a powershell window:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri https://get.scoop.sh | Invoke-Expression
```

Now run the `scoop` command to install `helm`
```powershell
scoop install helm
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Installing `kubectl`

<Tabs syncKey="OS">
  <TabItem label="MacOS">
Let's use [`homebrew`](https://brew.sh/) to install `kubectl`

If you don't have `homebrew` installed, install it with 

```zsh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Then install `kubectl` with
```zsh
brew install kubectl
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Windows">

In a powershell window, download the `kubectl` binary from Amazon S3

```powershell
curl.exe -O https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/amazon-eks/1.30.2/2024-07-12/bin/windows/amd64/kubectl.exe
```

Copy the binary to a folder in your `PATH`. If you have an existing directory in your PATH that you use for command line utilities, copy the binary to that directory. Otherwise, complete the following steps.

1. Create a new directory for your command line binaries, such as `C:\bin`.
2. Copy the `kubectl.exe` binary to your new directory.
3. Edit your user or system `PATH` environment variable to add the new directory to your `PATH`.
4. Close your PowerShell terminal and open a new one to pick up the new `PATH` variable.

### Installing `eksctl`

<Tabs syncKey="OS">
<TabItem label="MacOs">
To install `eksctl` we're going to use `homebrew`

```
brew tap weaveworks/tap

brew install weaveworks/tap/eksctl
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Windows">

`eksctl` for windows can be found [here](https://github.com/eksctl-io/eksctl/releases/latest/download/eksctl_windows_amd64.zip)

Unzip the archive to the `PATH` folder variable you created when installing `kubectl`
