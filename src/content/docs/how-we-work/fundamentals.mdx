# How We Work


## We Work in the Open

At our core, we believe in the power of transparency and collaboration. We embrace the philosophy of working in the open, which means that we strive to make our work, processes, and decisions visible and accessible to everyone in the team. By working in the open, we foster a culture of trust, accountability, and continuous improvement.

### Common Operational Picture
- Real-time information sharing: All participants have access to the same, up-to-date information about the situation, environment, and resources.
- Comprehensive situational awareness: The shared information provides a complete and accurate picture of the current state, including relevant facts, events, and trends.
- Collaborative decision-making: Participants can use the shared information to coordinate actions, make informed decisions, and adapt to changing circumstances.
