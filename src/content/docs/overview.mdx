title: Opportunity Overview
description: How we can contain and describe this deployment to Fidelity's restricted environment
---

## Security posture

- POCs are built in a development account in AWS. 
- OCP is not approved for production environments.
- Special considerations are required for CoreOS ami
- 

## Engineering infrastructure requirements

Per engineering doc:

- OpenShift Container Platform
- IBM Cloud Pak Foundational Services
- `cluster-admin` privileges are required

Below sizing are the base requirements for a extra small starter deployment.

|Flavor | Count | vCPU | RAM | Local Storage |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| TBD * | 1 | 4 | 8G | 500GB EBS | 
|c5.2xlarge|3|24 (8 cores x Count)|48G (16G x Count)| 100Gb EBS|
|m6i.2xlarge|3|24 (8 cores x Count)|96G (32G x Count)| 250Gb EBS|
|**Totals**|7|52|152G| 1053Gb |


## Open Questions

* Pre-Reqs call for 4 vcpu and 8 gig for the infra/bastion node. Can it get by with 2 vcpu? 

Reasoning: There isn't many options available in AWS that offer 4x8. Mostly 2x1, 2x4, 2x
